Estimate level difficulty of Candy crush

Candy Crush Saga is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world. The game is structured as a series of levels where players need to match similar candy 
together to (hopefully) clear the level and keep progressing on the level map. In this project, we will see how we can use data collected from players to estimate level difficulty.
